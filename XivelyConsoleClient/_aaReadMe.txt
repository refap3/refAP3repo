this was taken from Github as a netMF (4.1 and 4.2 ) sample to publish data to xively 
the original link is this: https://github.com/superstrom/Xively-NetMF

I did this: 

moved all classes into one Console App 
tested it with my libs ...

point to remember is the Current Culture Setting for Windows apps .....
