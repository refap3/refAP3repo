## PI_scripts 


### MLBC//KAVS repo
### read me hard

### following scripts are here: 

  * **g17all.sh**: send on off and test to GPIO 17 (used with 4 Port relay module and Android Pi Basic Controller app) 
  omg this is so cool a all in ONE script (passes parameters, uses case and runs a section as sudo) !!
  * **camall.sh**: integrate 3 Camera modes in one script, switch between scenarios: RaspiTimeLapse, adafruit camera master & Android RaspiCamRemote
